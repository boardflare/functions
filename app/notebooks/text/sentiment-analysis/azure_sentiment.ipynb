    "## Overview\n",
    "The `azureai_sentiment` Python function uses the [Azure AI Language](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/language-service/) service to analyze sentiment and opinions in the provided documents. It returns an array containing the sentiment analysis results with sentiment polarity at the document, sentence, and aspect levels. It also provides the opinions used at the aspect level.  \n",

    "### Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis applies sentiment labels to text, which are returned at a sentence and document level, with a confidence score for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "The labels are positive, negative, and neutral. At the document level, the mixed sentiment label also can be returned. The sentiment of the document is determined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Sentence sentiment | Returned document label |\n",
    "|--------------------|-------------------------|\n",
    "| At least one `positive` sentence is in the document. The rest of the sentences are `neutral`. | `positive` |\n",
    "| At least one `negative` sentence is in the document. The rest of the sentences are `neutral`. | `negative` |\n",
    "| At least one `negative` sentence and at least one `positive` sentence are in the document. | `mixed` |\n",
    "| All sentences in the document are `neutral`. | `neutral` |\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence scores range from 1 to 0. Scores closer to 1 indicate a higher confidence in the label's classification, while lower scores indicate lower confidence. For each document or each sentence, the predicted scores associated with the labels (positive, negative, and neutral) add up to 1. For more information, see the Responsible AI transparency note.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opinion Mining\n",
    "Opinion Mining is a feature of Sentiment Analysis. Also known as Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis in Natural Language Processing (NLP), this feature provides more granular information about the opinions related to attributes of products or services in text. The API surfaces opinions as a target (noun or verb) and an assessment (adjective).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a customer leaves feedback about a hotel such as \"The room was great, but the staff was unfriendly.\", Opinion Mining will locate targets (aspects) in the text, and their associated assessments (opinions) and sentiments. Sentiment Analysis might only report a negative sentiment.\n",
